                Hi there!, I’m Abdullah, a curious frontend developer who’s trying to get a bit better every day.
                <br></br><br></br>
                I currently studying in S.Y.BCA from Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth, Pune.
                <br></br><br></br>
                I have always had a knack for technology and working with computers. Fascinated with how intricate programming can be I was quickly drawn to learn more. I started learning JavaScript and was even more enthused with making websites interactive.
                <br></br><br></br>
                I’m very dedicated to learn new things and to truly believe that you should never stop learning. I enjoy creating different things, whether that be websites, application or anything in between.
                <br></br><br></br>
                I’m always looking for new opportunities to expand my understanding of web design and development, so you’ll generally find me sipping a delicious cup of coffee with my nose in a good “technical” book or plugged into my laptop drooling over all of the beauty the web has to offer. I hope to join a team of talented individuals I can learn from and build engaging digital experiences with.
                <br></br><br></br>
